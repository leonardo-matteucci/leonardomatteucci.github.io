            <h2>About</h2>
            <p class="large-margin">Born in Perugia, Italy, in 2000, Leonardo Matteucci is a composition student exploring inner corporeality, the mechanics of bodily articulations, and the tactility of acoustic-electronic hybridisation. He studied in Turin with Giorgio Colombo Taccani from 2019 to 2021, and in Fermo with Marco Momi from 2021 to 2023. He is now pursuing his Master’s in Composition under Franck Bedrossian at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz.</p>
